FY15: Compiling School- and Site-Level Enrollment and Dosage Goals.

Purpose: FY15 enrollment and dosage goals currently sit in spreadsheets, one MS Excel file per region, while data for each site/location are in separate tabs. These steps outline how to automatically pull enrollment and dosage targets from each of the 25 tabs and merge into a single data file suitable for analysis.

1.) Download/copy most up-to-date goals from cyconnect, and save in folder specified below.
    CYCONNECT: https://cyconnect.cityyear.org/funcserv/RSO/Goal%20Management/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=%2Ffuncserv%2FRSO%2FGoal%20Management%2FFY15&FolderCTID=0x012000DF5F215501704D44873A6A146F90AC8700AE00225C9FA67C4D8645F91A31955A72&View=%7B937BCFDF%2DD11E%2D452D%2D84E6%2DFDD1EBCACF1E%7D&InitialTabId=Ribbon%2ERead&VisibilityContext=WSSTabPersistence
    FOLDER: \\hqsfs.cityyear.org\eval_analysis\Cross Instrument\FY15\Source Data
    LIST OF FILES (5):
    Atlantic_FY15 Site Goals_Approved_Org Source of Record.xlsx
    MidWest_FY15 Site Goals_Approved_Org Source of Record.xlsx
    NorthEast_FY15 Site Goals_Approved_Org Source of Record.xlsx
    SOUTH_FY15 Site Goals_Approved_Org Source of Record.xlsx
    West_FY15 Site Goals_Approved_Org Source of Record.xlsx

2.) For each regional file, convert all formulas to values.
	Select all tabs, ctrl+a twice, ctrl+c, then paste special for values.

3.) Pull up R script "FY15 Compile Enrollment and Dosage Goals Dataset.R" from this location:
    \\hqsfs.cityyear.org\eval_analysis\github_syntax_files\FY15

4.) In the script, update line 11 to reflect the last date goals were compiled (FORMAT: YYYY-MM-DD, e.g. 2015-01-31).
	See \\hqsfs.cityyear.org\eval_analysis\Cross Instrument\FY15\Source Data\Check Data Headers YYYY-MM-DD.csv for latest copy.

5.) Run the entire script file.
    This script should result in three new files:
    Check Data Headers YYYY-MM-DD.csv
    FY15 School-Level Quarterly Enrollment and Monthly Dosage Targets YYYY-MM-DD.csv
    FY15 Site-Level Quarterly Enrollment and Monthly Dosage Targets YYYY-MM-DD.csv

6.) [Troubleshooting] Examine file "Check Data Headers YYYY-MM-DD.csv" to ensure that all variables are properly lined up. This file should show all of the variable labels from each original data file.
